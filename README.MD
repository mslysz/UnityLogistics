# Welcome to the Unity Logistics Website

This website was created using Bootstrap 5 and the SASS preprocessor. It serves as a landing page for Unity Logistics, an international transportation company specializing in freight transport worldwide. (This is an example of a page that can be used as a landing page for a transport company.)

## Technologies Used:

- **Bootstrap 5**: The main library for building responsive page layouts and utilizing pre-built components.
- **SASS**: A CSS preprocessor that allows for writing more modular and readable CSS code.

## Features of the Website:

- **Minimalistic Styling**: The styling of the website relies primarily on Bootstrap classes, enabling quick creation of responsive layouts without extensive custom CSS.
- **Landing Page**: The website is designed as a landing page to attract the attention of potential clients and encourage them to use the transportation services offered by the company.
- **International Character**: Due to the company's international operations, the website can be easily translated into various languages.

## Planned Features:

- **Translation to Other Languages**
  In the future, we plan to implement a feature allowing users to translate the website's content into multiple languages. This will involve integrating a language selection mechanism, enabling users to easily switch between different language versions. Translations will be stored in dedicated files for each language, ensuring efficient management and seamless user experience.

- **Day and Night Mode**
  Another upcoming feature is the introduction of a day and night mode option. Users will have the ability to toggle between light and dark modes, catering to their personal preferences and enhancing readability in different lighting conditions. The website's styling will dynamically adjust based on the selected mode, offering a visually comfortable browsing experience at any time of the day.
